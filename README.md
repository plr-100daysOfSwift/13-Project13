# InstaFilter

Hacking with Swift: 100 Days of Swift - Project 13

## Challenge

1. Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
2. Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
3. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.

## Project 15 - Challenge

Go back to project 13 and make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen. To make this work, set the alpha to 0 first.
